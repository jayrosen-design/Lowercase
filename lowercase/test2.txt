when he was nearly thirteen, my brother jem got his arm badly broken at the 
elbow. when it healed, and jem’s fears of never being able to play football were 
assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. his left arm was 
somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand 
was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. he couldn’t have 
cared less, so long as he could pass and punt. when enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. i maintain that the ewells 
started it all, but jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before 
that. he said it began the summer dill came to us, when dill first gave us the idea of making boo radley come out. i said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with andrew 
jackson. if general jackson hadn’t run the creeks up the creek, simon finch
would never have paddled up the alabama, and where would we be if he hadn’t?
